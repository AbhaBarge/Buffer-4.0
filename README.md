Using linked list, queue, array, dictionary, etc in Python, we have created a Scholarship Database that allows users to search for scholarships based upon their requirements using various filters based on age, gender, field (Science/Arts/Sports) and criteria (Need Based/Talent Based). It also comprises of a Wish-List feature that allows the user to store suitable scholarships for future reference.

The program will first require the user to Log In to an existing account or create a new account. It will then a display a menu (providing various filters available and options like Add to Wish-List and Remove from Wish-List). The program then performs the suitable operation based on the option selected by the user.






Buffer is a Data Structures and Algorithms Project series, in which students can participate as mentees in teams of 3-4 people. 
This year the themes on which students can create a project are-

1. Healthcare
2. Digital Society
3. Open Innovation
4. Custom data structure to store data

This repository is created for all the teams to be able to upload their final project source code for the same. 

While submitting, note that: 

Each folder should have the name of the team and inside a readme file with team member details, (name, year, branch) and their theme. The readme file should also contain the link to their presentation as well as the drive link where all the three report documents would be stored. 

Happy Coding :)
